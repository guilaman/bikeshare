The .csv files contain information on user trips with bicycles from a bikeshare
service in three different USA cities, during the first half of 2017.

The file bikeshare.py, when opened with Python from the terminal and
having the accompanying .csv files in the same directory, will prompt the user
for input on what city and time period they wish to display statistics about,
and return the specified information. The packages numpy, pandas, time and sys
are required; installing Anaconda will ensure having all necessary packages.

This project was originally done for an assignment part of a Udacity course I
followed in the summer of 2018.
The goal of the project was to demonstrate a certain knowledge of Python
programming, and understanding of descriptive statistics.

I upload this project to my personal GitHub profile as a work sample.
